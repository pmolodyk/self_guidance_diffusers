  I would like to thank my supervisor, Associate Professor Hu Xiaolin, for his guidance and exceptional ability to motivate students.

  This research was guided by Hu Zhanhao, without whom I would not have known how to start working in the area. 
  His close ex-colleagues, other members of our laboratory, Zhang Wei and TODO, also gave priceless advice on multiple occasions in both technical and research directions.

  I would also like to extend my gratitude to all the students in our laboratory for their enthusiastic help and support in weekly meetings and outside of them.

  The GPU resources were provided by the laboratory under Associate Professor Hu's supervision. 
  The experiments will be performed on the computational resources provided by the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Tsinghua University.
